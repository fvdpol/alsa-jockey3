 * github.com/fvdpol/alsa-jockey3/issues/48: on pi1test (armhf-prod), EP0
 * answers the first post-enumeration transfer (get_firmware) but has gone
 * fully silent by the next one 1-2 internal retries later, and the only
 * driver action in between is this function's usb_set_interface() pair.
 * The question this instruments for: does EP0 die during/because of
 * SET_INTERFACE, or is it already gone before the driver even gets there.
 *
 * trace_printk(), not dev_info(): the first cut of this used dev_info(),
 * and the race stopped reproducing at all -- 0/10 flapping runs where the
 * unbuilt driver flapped on roughly 4/5. pi1test runs with a live serial
 * console (console=serial0,115200, serial-getty on ttyAMA0), and printk
 * writes synchronously to every registered console; a ~70-character line at
 * 115200 baud is ~6-8ms, and this path logs 14 of them per call against
 * transfer gaps that were only a few hundred *microseconds* apart in a
 * clean run -- easily enough added latency to mask a narrow race entirely.
 * trace_printk() writes to ftrace's in-memory ring buffer instead of any
 * console, so it does not pay that cost. Read back from
 * /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace (or trace-cmd), not dmesg.
