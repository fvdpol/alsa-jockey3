/*
 * This file implements generic MIDI 1.0 Running Status handling. It is not
 * specific to the Ploytec chipset/firmware or to Jockey 3 hardware in any
 * way - it operates purely on a byte stream and has no dependency on USB
 * or on the rest of this driver. It lives here only because the Ploytec
 * firmware is the current reason it's needed (see
 * midi_running_status_expand() below). Should a second driver ever need
 * the same behaviour, this would be a reasonable candidate to migrate into
 * a shared kernel library instead of duplicating it.

#include "midi.h"

/**
 * midi_running_status_expand() - Expand MIDI 1.0 Running Status
 * @state: expander state, zero-initialised by the caller before first use
 * @b: the next raw MIDI byte from the source stream, in stream order
 * @dev: struct device for diagnostic logging (currently unused)
 *
 * MIDI 1.0 allows the status byte of a Channel Voice Message to be omitted
 * when it repeats the previous message's status ("Running Status"). Some
 * MIDI receivers don't implement Running Status and require every message
 * to carry its status byte explicitly; this function expands a Running
 * Status stream back into fully status-prefixed messages.
 *
 * Call this once per raw input byte. Most calls simply return @b unchanged.
 * When a data byte arrives while Running Status is active, the synthesised
 * status byte is returned immediately for the caller to send first, and @b
 * itself is queued in @state->queued_byte (with @state->has_queued_byte set)
 * for the caller to retrieve and send on the next output opportunity, ahead
 * of consuming any further input.
 *
 * Return: the next byte to send to the receiver.
